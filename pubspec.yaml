  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  assets:
    - assets/10.mp3
    - assets/11.mp3
    - assets/12.mp3
    - assets/13.mp3
    - assets/14.mp3
    - assets/15.mp3

    - assets/17.mp3
    - assets/18.mp3
    - assets/19.mp3

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
#  # fonts:
#     - family: Yanone
#       fonts:
#         - asset: fonts/YanoneKaffeesatz-ExtraLight.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  fonts:
     - family: Trajan Pro
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/YanoneKaffeesatz-Bold.ttf
